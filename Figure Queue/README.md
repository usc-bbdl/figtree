# Welcome to the Figure Queue for Valero Lab's Weekly Meeting

## Please upload your figures here each week by 7 PM (PST) the day before the lab meeting. A PowerPoint presentation will automatically be made with the figures in this folder.

## Additionally, please format the figures correctly, so that the corresponding slide title will be clear. Filenames should have the structure:

### This_will_be_your_slide_title_PRESENTERSNAME.FILETYPE

## such that the title of the slide will read "This will be your slide title (PRESENTERNAME)".

## Lastly, please only upload figures that are compatible with PowerPoint (No PDFs!).

### - Thanks!
